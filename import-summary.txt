ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .DS_Store
* CopyVuforiaFiles.xml
* README.md
* license.txt
* media/
* media/chips.jpg
* media/stones.jpg
* media/target_chips_A4.pdf
* media/target_chips_USLetter.pdf
* media/target_stones_A4.pdf
* media/target_stones_USLetter.pdf
* media/target_tarmac_A4.pdf
* media/target_tarmac_USLetter.pdf
* media/tarmac.jpg
* readme.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => app/src/main/assets/
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libVuforia.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libVuforia.so
* libs/jpct_ae.jar => app/libs/jpct_ae.jar
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
